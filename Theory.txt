studied about the overall crawler architecture.
major components: crawler, content processor, LLM service, embeddings service, enrichment service, and MongoDB storage.

went through main.py — entry point of the crawling process.
Learned how async crawler works
asyncio to handle multiple links at the same time.
aiohttp vs Playwright 
researched some on the general flow of markdown conversion and cleaning works.
how UpdateOne is used for performance


Got a basic idea of post-crawling processes — using LLMs, embeddings, enrichment steps.


currently still going through main.py and planning to go through content processor next.
